    <p>
        I am passionate about new technology designed to help those who are in need. I am currently at BSU with a major in GIMM (a merger of Computer Science and Graphic Art) and a minor in Biomedical Engineering. I have worked as a CNA for two and a half years. I excel at organization, communication and critical thinking.
